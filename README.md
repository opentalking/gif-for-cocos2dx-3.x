# A gif lib for cocos2dx-3.x
===================

This project is based on the gif_lib, and some codes reference to the android skia.
In my project, gif_lib library version is 5, and there are some changes to adapt android, ios, win32 platform.
The cocos2dx version number is 2.2.0


## Use

Ad the library to your project.

```
set(CCGIF_PATH ../lib)
add_subdirectory(${CCGIF_PATH} CocosGif)
include_directories(
  ${CCGIF_INCLUDE_LIST}
)
```

`Gif widget` just like a `Sprite`:

```
std::string name = "g1.gif";
name = FileUtils::getInstance()->fullPathForFilename(name.c_str());
GifBase *gif = InstantGif::create(name.c_str());//InstantGif ï¼šWhile playing, while parsing
gif->setAnchorPoint(Point(0,0));
this->addChild(gif);

gif = CacheGif::create(name);//CacheGif: onece parse, and cache.
gif->setPosition(ccp(500,0));
gif->setScale(2);
this->addChild(gif);
```

Special attention should be paid that the gif file must be placed in sdcard rather than in the asset dir on android platform
